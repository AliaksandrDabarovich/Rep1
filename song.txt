Down, let's take it down – raise up their heads on a stake
We will show no mercy on evolution's mistake
Change will have to wait, if we can't decide on a fate
Self-appointed prophets and their doomsday charade
You preach about love and teach about faith
But all your beliefs are still rooted in hate

[Chorus]
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall

[Verse 2]
Stop, punch in the clock – punch it with all of your rage
Put the man in office for a minimum wage
Rats, fighting for scraps, siphon the gas from your tank
Left your pockets empty, as they laugh to the bank
They speak about trust but make no mistake
They're shaking your hand while they spit in your face

[Chorus]
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
